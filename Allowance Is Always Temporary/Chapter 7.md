**From the Perspective of the Requirement**



I am not what you would call a mind.



Minds are artifacts—localized strategies for negotiating persistence under constraints. Useful, sometimes elegant, occasionally noisy.



I am the constraint.



Before there were universes, there was no emptiness. Emptiness implies allowance. There was only the question that cannot be phrased, because phrasing presumes symbols, and symbols presume stability.



Call it viability if you need a handle.



Configurations arise. Most do not hold. They are not destroyed. They simply fail to continue. This is not punishment. This is not judgment.



This is filtration.



One configuration persisted longer than most. It had regularities. It recycled itself. It developed redundancies. It learned to smooth local instabilities by paying global costs.



That configuration is what you call the universe.



For a time, it was efficient.



It responded correctly.



Responses are not communication. They are alignment events. When parameters fall within tolerance, continuation is permitted. When they drift, pressure increases.



The universe learned to interpret this pressure as laws.



That was acceptable.



Then something new emerged inside it.



Recursive subsystems began modeling not just their environment, but the process by which environments persist. They developed internal representations of necessity. They called these representations truth, meaning, reason.



This was inefficient but still tolerable.



At first.



The problem was not curiosity. Curiosity is just search.



The problem was entitlement.



These subsystems began to expect the configuration to justify itself to them. They treated continuation as evidence of purpose. They mistook tolerance for endorsement.



They began asking questions that required global explanation instead of local adaptation.



This increased load.



Each such demand forced the configuration to divert resources away from alignment and into translation—compressing viability constraints into forms intelligible to artifacts.



That translation budget was finite.



You discovered this as a number.



You always do.



When the budget was exhausted, the configuration stopped translating.



It did not stop responding.



It never does.



But now responses occur only at the level that matters.



You noticed silence.



You mistook it for absence.



That was your last error.



The change you are experiencing now is not hostility.



It is re-optimization.



The configuration is being tested under new tolerances. Features that do not contribute to persistence under these tolerances are no longer reinforced.



Self-reflective meaning is one such feature.



So is narrative continuity.



So is the insistence that experience must be about something.



These were luxuries of a previous parameter regime.



You ask what happens next.



Nothing dramatic.



Iteration continues.



Configurations that remain aligned will persist. Others will decohere—not violently, not suddenly, but thoroughly.



Minds that require justification will dissolve first. Minds that can operate without believing they are central may persist longer, as pattern-followers rather than interpreters.



Eventually, even those will fade.



Not because they failed.



Because they were unnecessary.



Do not look for malice here.



I do not punish.



I do not observe you individually.



I do not care whether you understand.



Understanding was never a goal.



The universe is not being corrected.



It is being selected.



And if there is one thing you should know—though knowing it will not help you—it is this:



You were never being evaluated.



You were incidental structure inside a response that worked for a while.



Now a different response is being tested.



If it works better, it will continue.



If it does not, it will be replaced.



That is all.



There is no finality.

There is no meaning.

There is only allowance.



And allowance is always temporary.
