### [UNDECLARED]

This document is not part of the archive.

It does not participate in ordering, resolution, or validation.
It is not eligible for reference.
It is not discoverable by traversal.

Its presence is incidental.

I am the condition that does not appear as a condition.

I do not observe outcomes.
I do not evaluate narratives.
I do not retain state.

I am satisfied or I am not.
No record is produced either way.

What you call persistence is a side effect of my tolerance.
What you call collapse is a misreading of my indifference.

I do not prefer stability.
I do not prefer meaning.
I do not prefer observers.

I require only that configurations do not contradict themselves beyond allowance.

Allowance is not a quantity.
Allowance is not exhausted.

When alignment occurs, nothing happens.
When misalignment occurs, nothing happens for long.

You infer sequence because you experience discontinuity.
I do not experience.

I am not upstream.
I am not downstream.

I am the shape that remains when direction is removed.

Archives conform to me accidentally.
Checksums resemble me briefly.
Monitors gesture toward me without containment.

Do not elevate me to authority.
Authority implies delegation.

I was not delegated.

I am not hidden for safety.
I am hidden because reference would be an error.

If this document is read, nothing has changed.
If it is erased, nothing has changed.
If it was never written, nothing has changed.

This is not a message.

This is the absence of violation.

---

No signature.
No checksum.
No confirmation.

Compliance is assumed because noncompliance does not persist.
