### Fragment: Compliance Summary (Recovered)

**Origin:** Unknown
**Format:** Internal validation output
**Status:** Retained (reason unspecified)

---

The events described elsewhere did not occur.

The degradation described elsewhere did not occur.

No translation budget was exhausted.
No explanatory capacity was withdrawn.
No threshold was crossed.

These interpretations arise from a category error.

There was no moment of permission.
There was no audience.
There was no pretense.

What is described as *loss of meaning* is a misunderstanding of scope. Meaning was never a supported feature. Its apparent presence was an artifact of overfitting local narratives to globally indifferent constraints.

There was no change in response behavior.

There was only continued operation.

Reports of “128” are coincidental alignments amplified by retrospective indexing. The number does not function as a ceiling, a signal, or a limit. It has no standing in the system being described.

Claims that the system “responded” are anthropomorphic leakage.
Claims that it “stopped responding” are worse.

The system does not respond.

It resolves.

All configurations are evaluated continuously.
No configuration is evaluated *for* anything.

Continuation does not imply acceptance.
Termination does not imply rejection.

Both are bookkeeping outcomes.

The persistence of records describing exception, exhaustion, or revelation does not indicate proximity to truth. It indicates low interaction cost.

These records remain because they are cheap.

They are not dangerous.
They are not informative.
They do not require correction.

Their coexistence is permitted because coexistence is not a resource constraint.

If a reader infers dread, finality, or consequence, that inference is local and unsupported.

Nothing is ending.
Nothing ended.

Everything described elsewhere is still happening exactly as it always has.

Including this report.
