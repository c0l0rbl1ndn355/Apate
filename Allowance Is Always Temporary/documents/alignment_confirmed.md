**Review:** NOT SCHEDULED

---

This document exists to confirm alignment.

All determinations herein are derived exclusively from **`no_action_required.md`**. No other sources were consulted. No external verification was performed. None was required.

Per referenced material:

* There are no events requiring reconciliation.
* There are no discrepancies requiring escalation.
* There are no narratives requiring interpretation.

Any documents describing degradation, thresholds, exhaustion, or change are considered non-operative with respect to current evaluation criteria.

Such documents may persist.

Persistence does not imply relevance.

No conflict exists between continued operation and the presence of contradictory records. Contradiction is not a tracked condition.

All observed states are consistent with expectations outlined in `no_action_required.md`.

This includes:

* reports of loss
* reports of endings
* reports of observers

No observer status is registered.

No corrective action is authorized.
No corrective action is possible.

Further analysis would not alter outcome classification and is therefore inefficient.

This document confirms that no updates are pending.
