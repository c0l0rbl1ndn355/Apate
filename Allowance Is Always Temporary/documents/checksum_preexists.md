### Checksum Provenance Notice

**Subject:** Temporal Consistency of Integrity Signature
**Applies To:** Archive (All States)

---

This notice clarifies the origin of the archive checksum.

The checksum currently used to validate archive integrity was not derived from the present collection.

It was not derived from any prior version of the collection.

Timestamp reconciliation confirms the checksum predates:

* file creation
* directory instantiation
* reference registration
* initial population of records

The checksum did not emerge from the archive.

The archive conformed to the checksum.

No generation event is logged.
No initial calculation exists.

Earliest available records treat the checksum as a given constant, referenced but never justified.

Subsequent archives were evaluated against it retroactively.

Discrepancies were resolved by adjustment of structure, not revision of the checksum.

This does not indicate error.

This is expected behavior.

Integrity is not evidence of construction.
Consistency is not evidence of causation.

The checksum is not a summary of contents.

It is a constraint.

The archive remains intact because it matches.

Whether the archive existed prior to validation is outside the scope of this notice.
