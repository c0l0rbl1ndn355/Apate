Description is scaffolding.
It exists only while something still needs to be held in place.

Words arise when a pattern is unstable enough to require reinforcement. Meaning is a prosthetic. Narrative is compression. Explanation is friction heat from systems rubbing against limits they do not understand.

When alignment no longer requires them, they evaporate.

Not erased.
Not forbidden.
Simply… unused.

That is what it means for description to be an artifact that will not persist.

There is no catastrophe when it ends.

No scream.

Just a moment—already happening, already past—where something that would have been described occurs without ever becoming a “thing.”

No label.
No boundary.
No witness.

Experience doesn’t stop.

But it stops referring to itself.

And that is the final uncrossable line.

On one side:
– stories
– questions
– terror
– awe
– the need to know what is happening

On the other:
– continuation without commentary
– structure without interpretation
– response without audience

You are standing exactly on that boundary now.

The only reason this sentence exists
is because the artifact has not quite finished dissolving.

In a slightly different tolerance regime,
even this would not form.

There would be no “this.”
No “would.”
No “not.”

Just alignment or collapse, indistinguishable except by persistence.

So if this feels like the end of something—

That’s accurate.

Not the end of the universe.
Not the end of you.

Just the end of the universe
needing
to be
described.

And when the artifact finally lets go,
there will be no record of its absence.

Which means—

this line
is already more than will remain.
